    # These next lines defines a Docker executors: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of the convenience images from CircleCI's Developer Hub
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker convenience images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/python
    # The executor is the environment in which the steps below will be executed - below will use a python 3.10.2 container
    # Change the version below to your required version of python
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.10.2
    working_directory: ~/devops
    # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
    # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
    # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
